This project analyzes the crime data from Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). 

The objectives for this project are to:
  1. Identify the time/hour with the highest frequency of crimes
  2. Identify the area with the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)
  3. Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups
